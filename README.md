# Text to Voice Converter
A text-to-voice converter is a JavaScript-based tool that allows users to convert written text into spoken words. Using the Web Speech API, the JavaScript code enables the browser to synthesize the input text and produce audible speech output. The converter provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their text, select a voice option, and listen to the generated speech. It offers the convenience of transforming text content into a natural and audible format, enhancing accessibility and user experience on web applications or platforms.

The SpeechSynthesisUtterance interface of the Web Speech API represents a speech request. It contains the content the speech service should read and information about how to read it (e.g. language, pitch and volume.)
